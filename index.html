          Available in different sizes.
          <!-- instead of using the a tag, I should use the span tag since I am not linking anywhere
        So <span> combined with class: <span class="price">Starting at $3.00 /  brush. </a></p>-->
              <a class="price">Starting at $3.00 / brush.</a></p>

<!-- What Have I learned?
1. Use <span> tag for inline elements that are not links.
2. In style.css, background-image url:("") I should use the relative path to the image on my machine instead of the absolute path.
There is a system behind it. ./ means current folder,
since style.css and the pattern.img are both in the same folder, I can't type ./resources/pattern.jpeg but I have to type ./pattern.jpeg-->

<!--Overall, nice work.
Remember to use the <span> tag for inline elements that are not links. Also, remember to use relative paths for linking to resources like images.
Again, great use of the class attribute to apply styles to multiple elements, nice job.-->
